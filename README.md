# Intro
Used GA version UA (not 4th version).
[GA\Gamp](/src/GA/Gamp.php) is a simple self-written class that sends a request to GA via curl.

# Results
In realtime, we can only see the presence of an event, but not its value
![Realtime events](/docs/gamp-realtime.png?raw=true "Realtime events")

We can see the values of events in the summary analytics with a delay of about 6 hours
![Events with values v1](/docs/gamp-ev-1.png?raw=true "Events with values v1")
![Events with values v2](/docs/gamp-ev-2.png?raw=true "Events with values v2")
